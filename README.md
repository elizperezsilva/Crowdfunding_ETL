# Crowdfunding_ETL
 Project 2

 # Background

In this project, I practiced building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline by using Python, Pandas and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data from contacts.xlsx and crowdfunding.xlsx 

After extracting and transforming the data , we created four CSV files and used the data from these files to create an ERD and a table schema. The CSV file data was then uploaded into a Postgres database. 

 # Instructions
 1. Create the Category and Subcategory Data Frames
 2. Create the Campaign DataFrame
 3. Create the Contacts DataFrame
 4. Create the Crowdfunding Database

#  Python Libraries
- Pandas
- NumPy

# Code Source
- ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code.ipynb provded in Project 2 file
